## Installation
This mod uses [FabricMC](https://fabricmc.net/)

How to install:
- assuming you've already got minecraft installed
- download [Fabric installer](https://fabricmc.net/use/)
- run the Fabric installer
  - point it at your existing Minecraft installation
  - tell it to install the client for Minecraft, version 1.16.4 (latest loader version is OK)
  - this will create something that looks like a separate minecraft version/installation 
    when you run the Minecraft launcher
- create a `mods` folder in your Minecraft installation
- download the Fabric API from
  [CurseForce](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files/all); you
  need to match the Minecraft version (use the "Game Version" filter) 
  and save it into the `mods` folder
- download the HelicopterMod jarfile from the github "releases" and put into the `mods` folder
