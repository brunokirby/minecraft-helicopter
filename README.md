## Installation
WIP

TODO check details, naming etc

This mod uses Fabric (link), docs etc

How to install:
- assuming you've already got minecraft installed
- download Fabric installer
- run the Fabric installer
  - point at existing Minecraft installation
  - tell it to install version xxx
- this will create something that looks like a separate minecraft version/installation
- create `mods` folder
- download fabric API & put into mods folder
- copy this into mods folder
