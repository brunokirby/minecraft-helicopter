TODO list
=========


- what should it drop if broken? parts (rotor etc)? 
- height of base?
- size of hitbox (should be smaller?)
- make it fly
  - basic: up with sprint?
  - custom key commands?
- placement rules (?)
- icon
- cleanup
optional:
  - aluminium


---

Done:
- shouldn't be pushable
- translation (in inventory)
- currently drops item.air but that can spawn helicopter (is weird)
- it's facing backwards :-)
- fix player height in vehicle when mounted / edit model
- craft from parts
- use the fine texture
