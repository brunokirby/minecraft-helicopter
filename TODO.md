TODO list
=========


- what should it drop if broken? parts (rotor etc)? 
- height of base?
- size of hitbox (should be smaller?)
- make it fly
- placement rules (?)
- icon
- cleanup
optional:
  - aluminium

motion planning:
- "1" up/down does takeoff/landing
  - start engine key?
  concepts of "flying" / "not flying"  
  optional: visuals/audibles
- "2" WASD does pitch/roll
- "3" move follows pitch/roll  
  while stationary, A/D does a "strafe"
  while moving, A/D does a banked curve
- "4" L/R keys do stationary yaw  
  (& while moving, slows you down & maybe off-bank & maybe crash)

---

Done:
- shouldn't be pushable
- translation (in inventory)
- currently drops item.air but that can spawn helicopter (is weird)
- it's facing backwards :-)
- fix player height in vehicle when mounted / edit model
- craft from parts
- use the fine texture
- custom key commands
